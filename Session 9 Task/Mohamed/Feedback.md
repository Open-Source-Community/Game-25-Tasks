# Positive Feedback

## Level Design

design of the level is good.

# Negative Feedback

## Player variables

- player speed and jump velocity needed to be tried to adjust them as needed, as the jump velocity and gravity isn't good, the gravity is too high for the player

## Camera

- the focus is not done correctly in the script as you must make the mouse hidden till the user press escape
- the camera sensitivity is too fast for the user and the player is rotating too fast, the sensitivity needs to be lower.
- also the camera perspective and FOV are bad for the player view, the camera is going in the objects while the player is not going through them as the camera is in front of the player by much distance not in the player, and the user is seeing too much far from the player itself.

> next time look at the instruction carefully, as we asked you to zip the project first then upload it, not the whole project.
