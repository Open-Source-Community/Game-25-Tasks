# Positive Feedback

## Level Design

The `level design` and architecture are outstanding. Each `room has a unique and colorful` experience, making exploration enjoyable. The way of `collecting coins` add an extra layer of fun.

## Scene Tree Organization

I love the `organization` of everything in there, like the `rooms are separated`, `boundaries` are clear, and I can easily find what I look for, `missing an empty node to collect all the coins`.

**Overall, good job on this task.**
