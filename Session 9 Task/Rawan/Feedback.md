## design

- design of the `level` is good, love the `bed`, `stairs` and every detail in the level.

## puzzle pieces

- the idea of making `puzzle pieces to collect` is good.

# negative Feedback

## duplication of puzzle pieces

- `do not duplicate puzzle pieces` then make a reference to each one of them, instead of this use `group to make all puzzle pieces` in this group and then `check if player touch` this object of group (puzzle) to call the function add score.
- also because of this logic, the `declaration of 10th puzzle piece` is not correct, it is put in the `previous else condition` of 9th puzzle piece, not correct like the others.

## the camera does not move

- the `camera does not move when the player is moving` the mouse, it should `move with the mouse when moving it`, so the player see rotate the camera with the mouse

## player's movement

- the player's movement like `speed and jump` needs to be improved and be tested more to make the velocity of jump and movement speed more good to play with.
