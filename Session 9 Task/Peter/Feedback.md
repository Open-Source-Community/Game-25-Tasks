# Negative Feedback

## Move Camera with mouse

Camera is attached to the player and with third person perspective, but the camera should be rotated with the player when moving the mouse, it is a must to make.

## Level Design

- The level is very simple, and missing texture to the obstacles or even the colors.
- The obstacles are made with static body, but it is easier to make it with the CSG Nodes like we made in the session project.

## Player Movement

Player is not moving with WASD as mentioned in the task

> i know u don't have much time for the tasks, but u should care more about it.
