# Task 10

Since we have learnt all about 3D assets, making levels and adding environments and lighting, this task we will implement everything we've taked uptill now.

## Make 2 level and link them

1. Make a player (just like last task, does not need a model or animations).
2. Make 2 levels/scenes.
3. The 2 scenes must be different enough. They can share assets but each should have a different layout.
4. Each level should have an environment. One should use a ProceduralSkyMaterial, while the other uses a PanoramaSkyMaterial
5. Each level should have a DirectionLight3D node, and atleast one other light source (SpotLight3D or OmniLight3D).
6. The player after going through the first level and reaching the end, should load into the second level.
7. Bonus: Add a model/mesh to the player and have the camera be in 3rd person
8. Bonus: Add any other game idea or system you want.

- point 6 is self-study, but is relatively easy to search for and implement. You might have already tried it before.
- You are free to use any assets you like from the internet. You can also look at the attached links for reference or to download from.
- The levels don't need to be complex, and don't need to be indoors. You can make outdoor scenes/levels if you want. Be creative!
